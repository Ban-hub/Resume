\section{About Me}
{\justifying \noindent
Most of my life taught me how fortunate I am to be able to adapt myself to any situation through discipline and perseverance. I am extrovert in nature and work very efficiently when I can communicate with another.\\
I love geometry, graphs, designing illustrations or 3D models and building small Unity game projects. Occasionally I solve programming problems online. Additionally I have some experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems. \\
For everything I am now, I praise the wonderful teachers for building me up to it.}
